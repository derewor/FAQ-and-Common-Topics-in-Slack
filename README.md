# FAQ-and-Common-Topics-in-Slack
# From Reactive to Proactive
## Objective:
The objective was to identify which FAQ topics were consuming the most time and causing inefficient communication cycles that slow down issue resolution. 

## Tools
google colab, panda, excel

## Structure
Results:/ Contains the result of the analysis and the insights as well as recommendations for the problems.

Analyzed data:/ Contains the analysed data used for ploting.

src:/ contains active codes which can be rerun with appropriate platform and data.

## Result

I analyzed frequently asked questions in a software development company's Slack channels and grouped them by topic based on frequency patterns. The company uses Slack for both internal developer communication and client interactions. Here are the mejor findings.

ðŸ“Š **The Pattern:**

- 11% technical issues â†’ 93% from developers
- 5% process questions â†’ 97% from developers
- 3.2% status follow-ups â†’ 95% from developers

**The Real Problem:** Our developers were spending more time asking questions than solving problems. This wasn't a support issueâ€”it was a communication design flaw.

**The Solution:** âœ… Proactive error notifications âœ… Self-service status dashboards

âœ… Visual workflow documentation âœ… Automated progress updates

**The Impact:** Transformed reactive questioning into proactive information flow. Developers now focus on building, not chasing updates.
